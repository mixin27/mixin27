## Introduction

Thank you for using Myanmar Calendar ("we," "our," or "the App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our mobile application.

- Payment information (app is free)
- Device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address, etc.) - *except as noted below for Firebase*
- **Your event details, descriptions, or locations**
- **Your reminder times or notification preferences**

### 2. Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is stored **ONLY** on your device and never transmitted to our servers:

- **App Settings**: Your theme preferences, language selection, calendar configuration
- **User Events**: All events, reminders, and recurring events you create
  - Event titles, descriptions, and locations

- No cloud synchronization (unless you explicitly enable backup in future)
- Complete data isolation - we have zero access to your event data

**Important**: Your event data never leaves your device. We cannot see, access, or share your event information.

### 3. Information Collected by Firebase

We use **Firebase Analytics** and **Firebase Crashlytics** to improve app performance and reliability. These services collect the following information:

#### Firebase Analytics Collects:

- App events and user interactions (e.g., which features you use)
  - *Example: "User created an event" (NOT the event details)*
  - *Example: "User set a reminder" (NOT when or what for)*
  - *Example: "User viewed calendar" (NOT what dates or events)*
- App session data (e.g., when you open the app, how long you use it)
- Device information (device type, OS version, language setting)
- Approximate location based on IP address (not exact GPS)
- Performance metrics and app crashes

#### Firebase Crashlytics Collects:

- Crash logs and error reports
- Stack traces from app crashes
- Device model and OS version
- App version information
- Custom error messages (sanitized - no personal data)

#### What Firebase Does NOT Collect:

- Your personal identity (name, email, phone number)
- Your calendar data or events
- Your event titles, descriptions, or locations
- Your reminder times or notification settings
- Your precise location
- Your browsing history outside the app
- Any content you create in the app

### 4. How We Use Firebase Data

We use this information to:

- Identify and fix bugs and crashes
- Improve app performance and stability
- Understand which features are most popular
- Monitor app health and reliability
- Enhance the user experience
- Optimize notification delivery
- Improve event creation workflow

---

## Local Notifications and Reminders

### How Event Notifications Work

Myanmar Calendar uses **local notifications** scheduled on your device:

- **Scheduled Locally**: All notifications are created and managed by your device operating system
- **No Server Required**: Notifications work completely offline without any internet connection
- **Privacy First**: Notification content (event title, time, location) never leaves your device
- **Your Control**: You can enable/disable notifications anytime in app settings

### What Notifications Collect

**We do NOT collect**:
- When notifications are triggered
- What notifications you receive
- How you interact with notifications
- Notification content or timing

**System Collects** (handled by Android/iOS, not by us):
- Basic notification delivery metrics (handled by your device OS)
- These metrics are not accessible to our app or Firebase

### Notification Permissions

When you enable event reminders, the app requests:
- **Android**: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission for Android 13+
- **iOS**: Notification permission through system prompt

You can revoke these permissions anytime through device settings.

---

## Recurring Events and Exceptions

### How Recurring Events Work

Myanmar Calendar implements recurring events with a "master event + virtual instances" pattern:

- **Master Event**: One database entry containing the recurrence rule
- **Virtual Instances**: Generated on-demand when viewing the calendar (not stored)
- **Exceptions**: Modifications to specific occurrences (stored locally)
  - Completed instances
  - Deleted instances
  - Modified instances (changed time, title, etc.)

### Privacy of Recurring Event Data

All recurring event data is stored locally:
- Recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Exception dates and modifications
- Instance-specific changes
- Completion status of individual occurrences

**We do NOT collect**:
- Your recurrence patterns
- How many recurring events you create
- Which occurrences you complete or modify

---
