## 🏗 Architecture

The project follow the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern combined with a robust **Offline-First** strategy.

### Component Relationship

    subgraph Presentation
        View[View / Pages]
        VM[ViewModel / Notifier]
    end

    subgraph Domain
        Provider[Riverpod Providers]
    end

    subgraph Data
        Repo[Repository Implementation]
        Remote[Remote DataSource]
        Local[Local DataSource]
    end

    View <--> VM
    VM <--> Provider
    Provider <--> Repo
    Repo <--> Remote
    Repo <--> Local
    Remote <--> API[Backend API]
    Local <--> DB[(Drift SQLite)]
```

### Key Principles
1. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State flows down, events flow up.
2. **Offline-First**: Data is always fetched from the local database first, with network updates happening in the background.
3. **Reactive UI**: The UI automatically updates when the underlying data in the database or state changes.
