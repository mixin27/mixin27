Sate Cha (“Safe” in English) application is designed merely for the partnered and trained service providers such as pharmacy staff, clinic staff, and outreach workers who will provide HIV/TB services to the targeted populations.

Through this application, the providers can do timely client registration, recording, distribution of self-test kits, and referral for linkage care including client monitoring, etc. All users registered through the Sate Cha online platform can get the required HIV and TB related services in a free and confidential way.

The app also has a linkage with the automated responding chatbot where the users can examine risk assessment for HIV and TB infection by themselves, get HIV self-testing independently, and seek help from service providers at any point.

All authorization and patent rights belong to the owner of the Sate Cha (chatbot) platform.
