## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
2. Android Studio with WearOS emulator or physical WearOS device
3. `very_good_cli` installed:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate very_good_cli
   ```

### Installation

1. **Create the project** (if starting fresh):
   ```bash
   very_good create flutter_app myanmar_calendar_wear
   cd myanmar_calendar_wear
   ```

2. **Copy all the provided files** to their respective locations in the project structure

3. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run on WearOS device/emulator**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Building for Release

### Generate release APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64
```

### Install on WearOS device:
```bash
adb -s <device_id> install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies:

- `myanmar_calendar_dart`: Core calendar calculations
- `wear`: WearOS-specific features
- `flutter_bloc`: State management
- `equatable`: Value equality
- `intl`: Internationalization

## Usage

### Navigation
- **Swipe left**: Next day
- **Swipe right**: Previous day
- **Tap "Today"**: Jump to current date
- **Tap language icon**: Change language

### Supported Languages
1. Myanmar (မြန်မာ)
2. English
3. Shan (ၽႃႇသႃႇ)
4. Karen (စှီၤကျိၤ)
5. Mon (ဘာသာမန်)

## WearOS-Specific Features

- Optimized for both **round** and **square** watch faces
- **Ambient mode** support (low-power display)
- **Scrollable content** for detailed information
- **Touch gestures** for navigation
- **Minimal UI** for glanceable information

## Customization

### Changing Default Language
Edit `lib/app/app.dart`:
```dart
AppLanguage _currentLanguage = AppLanguage.english; // Change default
```

### Adjusting Layout for Different Screen Sizes
Modify padding in `lib/features/day_details/view/day_details_screen.dart`:
```dart
padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(
  isRound ? 20 : 12,  // Adjust these values
  isRound ? 24 : 12,
  isRound ? 20 : 12,
  isRound ? 24 : 12,
)
```

### Adding New Widgets
Create new widgets in `lib/features/day_details/widgets/` and add them to the screen's column.

## Testing

### Run tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Test on WearOS emulator:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Create a WearOS virtual device
3. Run `flutter run` and select the WearOS device

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: App doesn't install on WearOS
- Ensure `minSdkVersion` is set to 26 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Check that WearOS feature is declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`

### Issue: Myanmar text not displaying correctly
- Ensure the device has Myanmar Unicode fonts installed
- Consider embedding custom fonts in the app

### Issue: Swipe gestures not working
- Check that `GestureDetector` is properly wrapping the content
- Ensure no conflicting gesture detectors in child widgets
